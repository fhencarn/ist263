                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Regional origin:</strong> Jerk began in Los Angeles, especially among young Black and Latino communities in California. It was as much about street dance battles and skate crews as it was about the music.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Early beats were stripped down with heavy 808s, crisp claps, and repetitive synth melodies perfect for dancing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dance element:</strong> Moves like the Reject and Pin Drop spread through dance crews, making the "jerkin" dance inseparable from the sound.</li>
                        <li><strong>Breakout song:</strong> New Boyz released "You're a Jerk" in 2009, pushing the scene into national awareness.</li>

                        <li><strong>Fashion:</strong> Skinny jeans, bright colors, snapbacks, Vans, and colorful sneakers defined the jerk aesthetic, turning it into a lifestyle brand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social media and YouTube:</strong> Platforms like YouTube and MySpace were crucial. Dance crews posted battles online, songs spread virally, and local jerk groups built followings.</li>
