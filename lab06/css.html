        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        
         
        <p>
            I live in Staten Island Ny with both my parents and my four other siblings. <br>Growing up we would watch a lot of tv mostly cartoons like regular show, amazing world of gumball, and Phineas and Ferb. <br>I still enjoy watching shows like Trailer Park Boys, Its always sunny and Philidelphia, and Curb your enthusiasm. <br>When Iâ€™m not watching TV, I like to create music, making beats or just using rhythm and poetry on hip hop type beats. <br>I find this a great and relaxing way to express myself. Some of the artists that inspire me are people like Tyler the Creator and Xaviersobased.
